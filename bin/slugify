#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This bash script defines a function called `slugify` that transforms a given
# string into a slug format. The function converts the string to lowercase,
# removes any characters that are not alphanumeric or hyphens, and ensures that
# there are no leading or trailing hyphens in the resulting slug.
# The script prompts the user to enter a string, reads the input, and then
# calls the `slugify` function to transform the input into a slug. Finally, it
# prints out the slug version of the input string.
# You can run this script in a terminal to quickly convert any string into a
# slug format.

slugify() {
  echo "$1" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '-' | tr -s '-' | sed 's/^-//; s/-$//'
  echo
