cat <<EOF
In the editor, modify 'pick' to 'edit' in the line mentioning the
commit you want to edit.

Save the file and exit: git will interpret and automatically execute the
commands in the file. You will find yourself in the previous situation in which
you just had created the commit.

At this point you can easily amend it. Make your changes and then commit them
with the command:

    git commit --all --amend --no-edit

After that, type:

    git rebase --continue

To return back to the previous HEAD commit.

EOF

git rebase --interactive "${1}^"
